# Welcome to Project Kancil

This is a self-hosting oriented project. 

The focus of the project is the following:
- Experimenting with Open Source Software and Self-Hosting in general
- Explore knowledge management tools to help my support my research
	- Automated YouTube Download
	- PDF management
	- Images management
	- Website monitoring and archiving tool
	- Self-hosted Notion alternatives
- Develop PDF AI chat to query large +1000 PDF data sets (academic journals, reports, and more)
	- Explore using locally hosted Chroma DB with OpenAI API
- Manage syncing / data transfer between local drives, Google Drives, One Drive, DropBox and Glacier storage

Yes, this website is hosted on GitHub and uses Obsidian. I've thought of moving to Logseq and hosting locally but thought the security risks aren't worth it at this point.
