        Welcome to Kancil Cerdik, the GitHub home for the Kancil Knowledge Management Project.
        <!-- Jekyll Garden is a markdown friendly theme lets you publish your Obsidian vault (or a subset of it) as a Jekyll static website. -->
        This is mostly a place to test out things and maybe share notes down the line.
        This website theme is based on <a href="https://jekyll-garden.github.io">Jekyll Garden</a>.
        <!-- Check out the <a href="{{'/notes' | relative_url}}"> demo </a>, <a href="{{'/post/features' | relative_url}}"> features </a> and <a href="{{'/post/how-to' | relative_url}}"> how to</a>. -->
